# üß† Image Classifier for Fashion MNIST Dataset

This project is an **image classification solution** using the **Fashion MNIST** dataset. We leverage **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** built with **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to accurately categorize grayscale images of clothing items into **10 distinct classes**. Additionally, we analyze the classifier‚Äôs performance using a **confusion matrix** for a comprehensive evaluation.

## üìå Problem Statement

The **Fashion MNIST dataset** provides a more challenging alternative to the classic MNIST dataset by offering grayscale images of fashion articles instead of handwritten digits.  
Our **goal** is to:

‚úÖ **Build an image classifier** capable of recognizing different categories of clothing.  
‚úÖ **Achieve high accuracy** on the unseen test dataset.  
‚úÖ **Analyze the model‚Äôs performance** by visualizing the confusion matrix to understand misclassifications and identify areas for further improvement.

## üìÇ Dataset Overview

- **Dataset:** [Fashion MNIST on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist)  
- **Description:** Contains 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) of 10 fashion categories:
  - `0`: T-shirt/top
  - `1`: Trouser
  - `2`: Pullover
  - `3`: Dress
  - `4`: Coat
  - `5`: Sandal
  - `6`: Shirt
  - `7`: Sneaker
  - `8`: Bag
  - `9`: Ankle boot

- **Split:**
  - **Training set:** 60,000 images  
  - **Test set:** 10,000 images

## üß™ Solution Approach

Our approach involves several well-defined steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading
We use TensorFlow‚Äôs built-in `datasets.fashion_mnist.load_data()` method to load the dataset into:
- **Training images & labels**: `(train_images, train_labels)`
- **Test images & labels**: `(test_images, test_labels)`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Preprocessing
- **Normalization:**  
  Pixel values originally range from 0 to 255. We **scale them to [0, 1]** for faster convergence during training:

  ```python
  train_images = train_images / 255.0
  test_images = test_images / 255.0
Reshaping:
The CNN expects a channel dimension (channels=1 for grayscale).
Reshape images to (28, 28, 1)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Architecture
We design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as follows:

Layer 1: Conv2D with 32 filters, kernel size 3x3, ReLU activation, input shape (28, 28, 1)

Layer 2: MaxPooling2D with pool size 2x2

Layer 3: Conv2D with 64 filters, kernel size 3x3, ReLU activation

Layer 4: MaxPooling2D with pool size 2x2

Layer 5: Flatten to convert 2D feature maps to 1D

Layer 6: Dense layer with 64 units, ReLU activation

Output Layer: Dense layer with 10 units (for 10 classes, no activation since we‚Äôll apply from_logits=True)

This design captures local spatial features in the images and progressively learns hierarchical patterns.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Compilation
We compile the model with:

Optimizer: Adam for adaptive learning.

Loss: SparseCategoricalCrossentropy with from_logits=True since we do not apply softmax in the last layer.

Metric: Accuracy to monitor classification performance.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training
We train the model for 10 epochs with 10% of training data as validation to monitor overfitting and fine-tune hyperparameters.

python
Copy
Edit
model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_split=0.1)

6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Evaluation
After training, we evaluate the classifier on the test dataset
This provides an unbiased measure of the model‚Äôs ability to generalize to unseen data.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Predictions & Probability
Since the last Dense layer does not include softmax, we append it during prediction
We then compute the predicted labels:
predicted_labels = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)

8Ô∏è‚É£ Confusion Matrix Visualization
To better understand misclassifications, we compute and plot a confusion matrix.
The confusion matrix highlights where the classifier struggles, e.g., confusing similar-looking items (like shirts and T-shirts).


üìà Key Takeaways:
‚úÖ CNNs are highly effective for image classification tasks.

‚úÖ Normalization and reshaping are critical to ensure proper data format for CNN input.

‚úÖ Confusion matrices offer valuable insights into model errors and areas for improvement.

‚úÖ This project forms a foundation for future enhancements such as:

Hyperparameter tuning

Data augmentation

Transfer learning using pre-trained models
